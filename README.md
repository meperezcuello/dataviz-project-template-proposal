# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is the The [World of Warcraft Avatar History Dataset](https://gist.github.com/meperezcuello/38533ec33abb5e0b3568fa4f91d97bb3) which is a **collection of records that detail information about player characters** that was cleaned and limited to less than 2 days of hourly data (since the dataset was limited to 5 mb). Understanding players behavior over playing time, allows the developers to examine posibles updates. futhermore, good Viz allows proper predict gaming time for any future update or server optimization and maintenance (you would not performing a maintenance, when most of your player population is online.

## Prototypes

I’ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a ... and it shows ...

(please put a screenshot of one or more visualizations of this dataset you already made, for previous assignments)

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * (insert your question or task here) How does the X vary over time?
 * (insert your question or task here) Is there any correlation between X and Y?
 * (insert your question or task here) Are there interesting spatial patterns in X?
 * (insert your question or task here) How many X are there across different Y?

## Sketches

(insert one or more hand-drawn sketches of interactive visualizations that you imagine)
(describe each sketch - how is the data visualized, what are the interactions, and how do these relate to the questions/tasks)

## Open Questions

(describe any fear, uncertainty, or doubt you’re having about the feasibility of implementing the sketched system. For example, “I’m not sure where to get the geographic shapes to build a map from this data” or “I don’t know how to resolve the codes to meaningful names” … Feel free to delete this section if you’re confident.)
